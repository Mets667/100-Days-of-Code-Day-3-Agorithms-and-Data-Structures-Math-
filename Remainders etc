Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)

Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.

const remainder = 11 % 3;
Again, I thought it was a *lot* harder than it looks, but it said it in the wording: "11 divided by 3." so there it is.

Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

myVar = myVar + 5;

One such operator is the += operator.

let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
6 would be displayed in the console.

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.

let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a = a + 12;
b = 9 + b;
c = c + 7;

I had to cheat; I have ZERO idea what exactly they're asking for. SO...it's:

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;

and that works.
